#Caesar Cipher

This project was created as part of the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project) curriculum.

A caesar cipher is a way of encoding messages. The idea is to take each letter in your message and shift it by a certain number across the alphabet to get a new letter. I made a basic Ruby method to create a cipher and used the web framework Sinatra to create the app. The app is hosted on [Heroku](http://langenfeld-caesar-cipher.herokuapp.com/).
